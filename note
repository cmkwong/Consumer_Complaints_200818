1. 	Converge faster and better than #1
2. 	generate batch at each step
3. 	Inside of each of batches is relative and had relationship, 
		for example, in batch_1, they are sampling from same domain and codomain
		however, #1 is sampling different domain and codomain in a batch 

Issue:
1. only one codomain is trained and it take too long
